The first step of the game loop is typically to recieve input from a player that can then be processed by the engine.\n\nExamples of potential inputs include:\n- Button presses\n- Mouse movement\n- Gyro sensors like a phone tilting\n- Sound activation from a microphone\n\n## Process\nOnce the game engine receives input, it can now process or update the state of the game.\n\nExamples of what can be updated:\n- Object physics\n- Enemy Health\n- Player Experience\n\n## Render\nNow that game state has been updated, the final step is to display the new game state on the screen. After rendering, the game loop returns to the initial state of reading inputs and continues looping until the game terminates.\n\n# Implementations\nThe game loop runs continously as the driving force of the game engine. In modern computing however, machines come with different specifications that can affect performance in varying ways.\n\nThis performance variation can have an affect on the game loop depending on how fast or slow a machine runs. For example as video games are largely a visual medium, the render step within a gameloop is typically tied closely to the speed at which [[Frame|frames]] are rendered. A game with logic tied directly to FPS may have enemies moving faster on a high-end machine compared to a low-end machine.\n\nTo handle this, there are two main methods of implementing a game loop, both with their own benefits and flaws. Deciding on which to use for your game engine depends on the type of game and target hardware being developed for.\n\n## Fixed Time-step\nasdf\n## Variable Time-step\nasdf","lastmodified":"2023-07-30T11:25:17.233390787Z","tags":["gamedev"]},"/GameDev/Game-Physics":{"title":"Game Physics","content":"# Movement\n### Speed\nThe rate of change of position over a fixed time-step in any direction.\n\u003eSpeed = Distance / Time\n\n### Acceleration\nThe change of speed over a given time.\n\u003eAcceleration = Δ Speed / Δ Time\n\n### Velocity\nThe speed of an object in a given direction.
