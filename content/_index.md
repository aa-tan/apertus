Welcome to the Codex Omnia! This site is kind of like a personal wiki of all the things I find interesting with a bit of blogging thrown in as well. Since it's only really topics that fit my tasteful palette, the name of the website a bit of a misnomer but Latin sounding titles are cool and I'm all about style points.
