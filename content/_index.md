Welcome to the Codex Omnia! This site is kind of like a personal wiki of all the things I find interesting with a bit of blogging thrown in as well. Since it only really covers topics that fit my tasteful palette, the name of the website a bit of a misnomer but Latin sounding titles are cool and I'm all about style points.

Feel free to explore this [[digital_garden|digital garden]] at your own pace. The *Graph View* displays a chart representing the current page and its connections to other pages. Click a node to be taken to the entry. The button at the top right of the graph will show the relational chart of the whole site. As this wiki grows, the chart will also expand and increase in complexity. Neat!
