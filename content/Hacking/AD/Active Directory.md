Active Directory (commonly abbreviated as AD) is a software suite used to administrate the privileges of computers and its users.

Developed by Microsoft, AD operates on the logic that all computers and users, whether individually or as a group, are treated as an "[[object]]". Policies can be applied to objects in order to permit or deny certain actions such as opening a specific file or running a command.

The benefit of AD is in its network capabilities. AD can be run across multiple hundreds of computers, allowing resources to be shared while still maintaining the proper privileges. For this reason, many companies and schools will install Active Directory in order to easily set up and manage the IT infrastructure of the organization.
